This is my first online web application using JavaScript as part of my Web Developer Training Course at AFPA.


It's a famous game where the two players choose between __Rock__, __Paper__ and __Scissors__. The winner is the one who has chosen the strongest item:

* __Rock__ beats __Scissors__
* __Scissors__ beat __Paper__
* __Paper__ beats __Rock__

If both players choose the same item, it is a __draw__.


In this project, the second player is played by the computer. When the first player (the computer's user) accesses the website, he will see a __welcoming message__ asking for __his name__. The program will then address the player by his name and ask him to __choose an item__. After that the __computer's choice__ will be announced and finally, __who is the winner__.
